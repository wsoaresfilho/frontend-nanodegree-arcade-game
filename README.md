##Game Instructions


###Objective
The game is really simple and It´s very easy to play.
The objective of the game is to cross all the way to the water side. But there is a very important detail: **You cannot touch the bugs!** If this happens, you loose and have to restart the game. If you have good game skills, you will get to the water side and will win the game. When you win, the game restarts so you can keep playing.


###How to play
To play the game, all you need is a keyboard so you can use the Up, Down, Right and Left keys. Each of these keys move the player to the corresponding direction. And that´s all! Have fun:exclamation: :thumbsup:
